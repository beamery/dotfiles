    ◦ House lights dimmed
    ◦ Dressing room mirror lights remain on
    ◦ Lighting focuses a bit more on the scene
 • Third play
    ◦ House lights off
    ◦ Dressing room mirror lights dimmed so as to fall into the background
    ◦ Lighting fully focuses on the play

Lighting as it pertains to the meaning

 • Mimics the relationships of the three pairs of characters
    ◦ *First pair*
       ▸ Just married (on a whim?)
       ▸ Their love seems contrived, easily made unstable
       ▸ Make several mistakes throughout the act, seem out of character a lot
       ▸ Lighting mimics this lack of seriousness in their relationship
          ▹ I couldn’t tell if it was real, or a rehearsal
          ▹ Seemed somewhat contrived, little effort put into it
          ▹ The love in their relationship seems to be in a state of rehearsal
             ▪ They try to love each other, but cannot stop arguing
                ▫ Their love still needs much rehearsing in order for it to seem real
    ◦ *Second pair*
       ▸ Married longer than the first
       ▸ Were once in love
          ▹ wife seems to have fallen out of love with her husband
          ▹ There still appears not to be true love between the characters
          ▹ Lighting mimics this
             ▪ Seems much closer to being “right”
             ▪ However, you are still able to see what is going on in the background
                ▫ Dressing room mirror lights remain on, illuminate the husband, even while he is out of character
                ▫ This lighting choice makes it difficult to see the play as genuine and sincere
                   • Instead, it keeps an audience member from becoming truly immersed in the play
                      ◦ Much like the characters’ lack of ability to be immersed in their love for their spouse
    ◦ *Third pair*
       ▸ Most of the play is about courtship
       ▸ It is in this play that the love between the characters seems most sincere
       ▸ There is very little doubt in the love between the characters, does not feel contrived at all
       ▸ The lighting strengthens this feeling
          ▹ The dressing room mirror lights are dimmed
          ▹ The house lights are completely turned off
          ▹ The stage is well-lit, a clear area of focus in the room
          ▹ Due to these lighting choices, the audience members can become immersed in the play
          ▹ The play feels well-rehearsed, natural, and in the scene change, the lighting is reduced, maintaining the natural feeling
