Othello

 • Why does Iago destroy Othello?
    ◦ Jealousy of the purity of the other characters
       ▸ Jealous of the benevolence of the other characters in the play
          ▹ Destroys Cassio’s reputation by exploiting a weakness, Cassio seems helpless throughout most of the play
          ▹ Destroys Desdemona’s reputation by convincing Othello that she is cheating on him
          ▹ Allies with Roderigo, the only character in the play working towards a selfish goal
          ▹ Destroys Othello through convincing him wrongly to kill his wife
       ▸ Does not hate Othello more than any of the other “pure” characters
          ▹ Othello has the most to lose
          ▹ His hatred focuses most around Othello because Othello is black
             ▪ His appearance is impure, yet he remains well-respected because of his benevolent personality
