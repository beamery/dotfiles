 • Society today is much different than it was 180 years ago
    ◦ As society has evolved, the media has evolved to match it
       ▸ In the modern day, America’s youth gets a majority of their information from the mainstream media      
       ▸ The rise of modern entertainment (TV, movies) has led to the fall of theatre out of the mainstream
       ▸ Naomi Iizuka hopes to address this issue in _Skin_.
             ▪ Skin modernizes the social issues raised in Georg Buchner’s Woyzeck, which address the individual’s role in society.
             ▪ It condemns the power of the societal machine which drives the mainstream / warns against the blind acceptance of the media as an information source.
             ▪ Through these themes, Skin reaches out to the American youth and offers theatre as an alternative to the financially-driven mainstream media.

 •  Two main differences between Skin and Woyzeck
    ◦ Source of insanity
       ▸ Woyzeck → unreasonable demands from authoritative figures
          ▹ Both the doctor and the captain treat him like a lesser being due to his financial status, and his desire for individuality is thwarted by their constant demands
       ▸ Jones → the loss of individuality in modern society

       ▸ Music in Skin 
          ▹ Music is a major point in which the loss of individuality is apparent
          ▹ Historically, music has served as a way to express individuality, often as a way to protest against authority
             ▪ However, as financial corporations have taken over the music industry, the mainstream has become more and more driven by financial motivations
                ▫ Has become more about mass appeal, and thus, the sound coming from these record companies is often quite generic
          ▹ In Skin, music has turned into a negative stimulus for Jones
             ▪ He walks into the club, and describes it as “so loud it makes your skull hurt”
             ▪ You can tell that the nuances are lost due to the volume and what you’re left with is very generic, loud dance music
             ▪ For many people, this is ok, but Jones sees it as another example of the draining of individuality by the corporate machine
                ▫ Unable to embrace the music, Jones leaves the club

    ◦ The role of the child in the play
       ▸ Woyzeck
          ▹ The child remains silent, is never given a name, and has little significance to the development of the plot
       ▸ Skin
          ▹ Iizuka gives the child a voice
             ▪ Serves as a symbol of the American youth
                ▫ Is cautious to believe what other people tell her
                   • Recognizes evils of society
                ▫ However, unlike Jones, she remains optimistic
                   • When the chaotic sounds of society fill her head, she comforts herself with the cheerful sound of Mexican music
 
 • This mental outlook is what Iizuka sees when she examines the American youth
    • By adapting an older play, she maintains the viewpoint that theatre as an artform can be just as relevant today as it was 180 years ago. 
    ◦ However, by modernizing key points of the play, she exposes the evils of modern society, specifically modern media
       ▸ In this modernization, she also creates a play that is much more relatable to the modern American youth
       ▸ Iizuka hopes that by getting young people to come see Skin, they will open their minds to theatre as a contemporary artform
