MaRainey

 • Women’s acting choices and how the affected the production as a whole

 • Ideas
    ◦ Ma Rainey’s character suppressing the dominance of the white males in the studio
       ▸ Body language
          ▹ Stands straight up, her head tilted slightly upwards
             ▪ Statement of class and sophistication
             ▪ Stands through most of the play
                ▫ In contrast to Dussie Mae, who sits for the majority of the play
                   • Dussie Mae moves much more suggestively (swaying of hips, seems to be pouting a lot)
                ▫ This contrast accentuates the authority of Ma Rainey 
          ▹ Several instances in which she turns her back when the White men are talking to her
             ▪ Shows that she doesn’t need to suc up to them to get what she wants
       ▸ Voice to Whites
          ▹ Tone
             ▪ Strong, assertive, threatening tone to her voice
             ▪ Continually asserts her dominance over the White men in the recording studio
             ▪ Comes off as somewhat tyrannical
       ▸ Voice to Blacks
          ▹ Maintains the strong, powerful tone
          ▹ However, rather than threatening, her voice becomes constructive
          ▹ Like a motherly figure, rather than a tyrant
