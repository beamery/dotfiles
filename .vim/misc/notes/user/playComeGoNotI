playComeGoNotI

Play
 • Characters all in limbo?
    ◦ purgatory?
 • Urns
    ◦ Symbolize the entrapment inside their own thoughts

Come and Go
 • Proximity
    ◦ As the middle person in each scene leaves, the other two come closer together
    ◦ As their physical positions come closer together, they gain a common bond through gossiping about the other
       ▸ In the beginning of the following scene, the two who were gossiping are positioned side by side, with the other left out
    ◦ By the end of the play, all three have a common bond to the other two, based on their feeling of superiority over the one left out
       ▸ They reclaim their original positions, with the two outer characters joining to form a ring of friendship
 • Dependence
    ◦ Each character is dependent on the others, distinctly different characters, whom are differentiated through the other characters’ proclamation of their weaknesses
    ◦ Alone, each character is portrayed as weak
       ▸ However, when they all join hands, they form a stronger union
    ◦ Distinguished only by coat color and the sound of their “Oh”
    ◦ Presumably, they were previously good friends, and were somehow separated 
       ▸ “May we not speak of the old days? Of what came after? Shall we hold hands in the old way?” (Vi 386)
       ▸ When they do join hands, they recognize the comraderie of old, Flo can “feel the rings.” (Flo 386)
          ▹ Rings a symbol of marriage?
