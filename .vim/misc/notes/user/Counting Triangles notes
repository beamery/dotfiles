Counting Triangles notes

 • There are a total of C(n,3) combinations of 3 vertices for a given grid
    ◦ Where n = (height + 1) * (width + 1)

 • However, we must eliminate vertices which are all in a straight line.
 • Therefore, any combinations of three vertices on a given row must be eliminated
    ◦ For one row, this should be equal to — C((width + 1), 3) * height + 1
       ▸ (width + 1) is the number of vertices horizontally
       ▸ We multiply by (height + 1) for the number of total horizontal combos
    ◦ Likewise, one column should equal — C((height + 1), 3) * width + 1

 • Not quite sure how to handle the diagonal ones yet...
    ◦ Maybe do it by brute force?
    ◦ Actually...
       ▸ We know that the grid is rectangular, so...
          ▹ Take the top vertex from each column (starting in the top left)
          ▹ Figure out how many vertices(v) are in its diagonal
          ▹ C(v,3) to figure out the total combinations of vertices for the diagonal
          ▹ Then...
          ▹ Go down the left-hand side
          ▹ Do the same for each vertex in the leftmost column
          ▹ Multiply total result by 2 to get the total diagonal count to subtract

 • I’m pretty sure that sums it up
