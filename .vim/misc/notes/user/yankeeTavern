yankeeTavern

 • Yankee Tavern brings two generations together with Ray’s superstition pit against the optimistic, but skeptical Adam
 • By the end of the play, Adam’s optimism is defeated with the facts laid out in front of him.

 • Opening music - Duke Ellington
    ◦ Roaring Twenties an iconic decade for the optimism of Americans.  The music reflects this
       ▸ Duke Ellington describes his music as “American Music” rather than jazz
    ◦ These particular renditions are performed by the finalists of Lincoln Center’s Essentially Ellington competition (high schoolers)
       ▸ The decision to choose high school recordings is used to symbolize the Adam’s optimism, his reluctance to give in to the conspiracy theories

 • Closing music - Vietnam Era 
    ◦ Few times in American history has there been such distrust in our government
    ◦ At the end of the play, it is made clear that Ray’s superstition is rooted in truth
    ◦ The contrast between the optimism of the opening music and the pessimism of the post-show music highlights the change in mood of the play from beginning to end
    ◦ It also serves as a symbol for Ray’s superstition and the divide between the two generations
       ▸ Ray was alive during the Vietnam Era
       ▸ For much of his life, he has had reason to doubt the good will of the government, his superstitions are not unfounded
